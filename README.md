# Courses repo
Various projects accomplished while attaining (online) courses. This is not a working github repo, rather just a collection of already finished projects to look up the code for particular solutions. Since GitHub sometimes has problems with rendering files like Jupyter notebooks, I backup projects with links to nbviewer, RPubs or else. Keywords are highlighted in bold.  

## R
### Explorative Data Analysis case study
Using **dplyr**, **ggplot2**, and **broom** to analyze the voting behavior of countries in the United Nations General Assembly.  
GitHub: []
### Multivariate Statistics and Visualization
Applying multivariate techniques and plotting the results. Working with a dataset on wine sorts.  
GitHub: [link](r/datacamp/mva/mva_r.md)  

## Python
### Analysis of Android Apps Popularity  
Basic data handling using **pandas**. Data visualization using **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, and **plotly**.  
GitHub: [link](python/datacamp_apps.ipynb)  
nbviewer: [link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/alexmerk/courses/blob/master/python/datacamp_apps.ipynb)

### Credict Card Rating Applications
Using **logistic regression** with **scikit-learn** to predict approval ratings for issuance of credict cards. Includes simple code for **grid search**. Completed as a part of Datacamp's "Data Scientists with Python" career track.
