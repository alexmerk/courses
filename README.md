# Courses repo
Various projects accomplished while attaining (online) courses. This is not a working github repo, rather just a collection of already finished projects to look up the code for particular solutions. Since GitHub sometimes has problems with rendering files like Jupyter notebooks, I backup projects with links to nbviewer, RPubs or else. Keywords are highlighted in bold.
