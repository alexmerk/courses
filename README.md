# Courses repo
Various projects accomplished while attaining (online) courses. This is not a working github repo, rather just a collection of already finished projects to look up the code for particular solutions. Since GitHub has some restrictions on displaying files like HTML or Jupyter notebooks, I backup projects with links to nbviewer, RPubs or else. Keywords are highlighted in bold.  

## R
### Multivariate Statistics and Visualization
Applying multivariate techniques and plotting the results. Working with a dataset on wine sorts.

### Explorative Data Analysis case study
Using **dplyr**, **ggplot2**, and **broom** to analyze the voting behavior of countries in the United Nations General Assembly.  
GitHub: [raw html]
RPubs: [link](https://rpubs.com/alexmerk/640576)  

## Python
### Analysis of Android Apps Popularity  
Basic data handling using **pandas**. Data visualization using **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, and **plotly**.
